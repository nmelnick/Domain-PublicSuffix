  - Add Default updater
  - Fix warnings in tests

0.16    2019-10-18 20:00 GMT
  - Refresh PublicSuffix list
  - Add publicsuffix.org unit tests
  - Force lower case on ASCII domains
  - Rewrite suffix parser to both more closely match publicsuffix intentions,

    #3

0.15    2019-04-23 20:00 GMT
  - Refresh PublicSuffix list
  - Merged pull request from Gavin Carr to explicitly open a file with UTF-8
    encoding
  - Bump Net::IDN::Encode requirement to 2.401 to avoid unicode issues
  - (#3) Provide a tld and suffix even with asking get_root_domain for a valid
    suffix that is not a valid domain. Will still report 'Domain not valid',
    but ->suffix and ->tld will resolve.
  - Make sure that the error condition from get_root_domain still throws when
    a root domain is already fired, but that it still returns.

  - Remove Data::Validate::Domain dependency by simplifying the domain validity

    the PublicSuffix match.
